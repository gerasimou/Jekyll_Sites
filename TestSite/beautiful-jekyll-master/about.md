subtitle: A few words about RS seminars @ CS UoY

The Research Student seminars are organised by research students **for** research students. The seminar series support a broad range of talks, filling the gaps left behind by, for example, the staff research seminars and research group seminars.

Here are but a few possible themes for seminars – other suggestions are welcome!

* Short research talks: introduce your colleagues to your research.
* Tools and techniques (e.g. masterclass on reference management software).
* Careers, both academic (e.g. careers panel with academics, writing proposals) and non-academic (e.g. presentations from the careers service).
* Getting the most of your time as an RS (e.g. managing time, taking advantage of conferences).
* Meeting the researchers around you (e.g. our “international lunch”).
